Hey there, welcome!

My name is Erick and I am a dedicated Internet Systems student who is excited to take my first steps into the world of Front-end.
Currently, I am in a career transition to the programming area and have knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript and React.js
  
💞️ I love alternative rock, volleyball and good gastronomy.

🌱 I’m currently learning about responsive designs.

👀 I'm looking for an opportunity to develop my knowledge and become a front-end programmer.
